    <h1>He For She</h1>
    <p class='detail'>“I’m inviting you to step forward, to be seen, and to ask yourself…If not me, who? If not now, when?” - Emma Watson
      <br>HeForShe is a solidarity campaign that works towards the advancement of women by seeking support from men and boys all over the world. The campaign is initiated by its parent body, UN Women. It encourages men and boys all over the world to stand
      up against the negative inequalities faced by the women globally. Believing the idea that gender equality is not just a women issue but a human rights issue, it seeks to actively involve the unaffected community-men and boys, replacing the original
      notion “a struggle of women by women”.
      <br>The world is at a turning point. People everywhere understand the idea of gender equality and realize that it affects all people-socially, economically and politically. UN Women organization kick-started the HeForShe campaign on 20th September,
      2014 in New York hosted by UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, Emma Watson, who formally extended a hand towards all the men and boys to join the movement.
      <br>The campaign records the global engagement by counting the number of men and boys who take the HeForShe pledge. The campaign frames and implements plans for UN agencies, individuals, and civil society, as well as those on universities and colleges,
      both through online and sustained engagement. It started as a pilot campaign but now considered as one of the most impactful campaigns that has its efforts deeply devoted towards protecting women rights and lifting their status equal to men.
