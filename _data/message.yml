  designation: Secretary General
  message: Greetings Delegates,<br><br>Ever since I did my first MUN, I realised that it's not just about what you say, itâ€™s about why you say it. As a delegate, you hold a responsibility to be the voice for a whole nation, a representative who speaks for his/her people. Their words, ideas, needs, rights and aspirations are all heard from your mouth.<br>It is unfortunate that over the past few years the concept of MUN has deviated from what actual UN stands for, i.e., every country uniting together to solve world issues, which is the essence of the United Nations.<br>We, here at JECRC, intend to provide you with an experience and environment of pure diplomacy and debate, along the lines of the United Nations.<br>It is an honour and a moment of pride to be the Secretary General of the seventh edition of JECRC MODEL UNITED NATIONS and an even greater pleasure to be a part of the great legacy it holds. This year we will be simulating five committees and deliberations between delegates from all across the country and on behalf of my entire team, I extend a very warm welcome to you all for JECRC MUN 2018.<br><br>Saloni Sharma<br>Secretary General,<br>JECRC MUN 2018
